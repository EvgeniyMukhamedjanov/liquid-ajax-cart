# data-ajax-cart-bind-state

Add the `data-ajax-cart-bind-state` attribute to an HTML element, pass a [State object](/reference/state/) property as the attribute's value and Liquid Ajax Cart will display the state property's value within the HTML element and refresh it when the cart gets updated.

{% include code/data-ajax-cart-bind-state.html %}

On the [demo store](https://liquid-ajax-cart.myshopify.com) it is used to show the amount of cart items next to the "Cart" link in the header.
