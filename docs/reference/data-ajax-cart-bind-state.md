# data-ajax-cart-bind-state

Add the `data-ajax-cart-bind-state` attribute to an HTML element with a path to a [State object](/reference/state/) property as the attribute's value and Liquid Ajax Cart will keep the text content of the element in sync with the state property value.

On the [demo store](https://liquid-ajax-cart.myshopify.com) it is used to show the amount of cart items next to the "Cart" link in the header.
