## Options

The `options` parameter is an object and it might have the following properties:

#### firstComplete

The `firstComplete` parameter is a function that will be called right after the request is finished and before any other callbacks that are subscribed to the request. 

This function is called before updating of the [State](/reference/state/) object, the `data-ajax-cart-section` sections, the `body` CSS classes, the `data-ajax-cart-bind-state` elements.

The `firstComplete` function will be called with the only parameter — the [Request state](/reference/requestState) object.

#### lastComplete

The `lastComplete` parameter is a function that will be called after the request is finished and after any other callbacks that are subscribed to the request. 

You can use the [`getCartState`](/reference/getCartState/) function to read the [`State`](/reference/state/) object because it is already updated.

Also the `data-ajax-cart-section` sections, the `body` CSS classes, the `data-ajax-cart-bind-state` are updated when the function is called.

The `lastComplete` function will be called with the only parameter — the [Request state](/reference/requestState) object.

#### info

The `info` parameter is a simple Javascript object that will be attached to the [Request state](/reference/requestState) object. You can add your own data to the request state using the `info` parameter. 

Don't use the `initiator` and the `cancel` keys:
* [Product forms](/reference/product-forms/) and [Controls](/reference/controls/) that send Cart Ajax API requests attach their HTMLElement objects to the `initiator` property of the `info` parameter.
* If the `info` parameter has the `cancel` property and it is `true`, the request will not be performed. It might be useful when you intercept a Shopify Cart API request using the [subscribeToCartAjaxRequests](/reference/subscribeToCartAjaxRequests/) function and decide to cancel the request.

#### newQueue

If the `newQueue` property is `true` then a new queue will be created and the request will be added to the new queue.

If the `newQueue` is not defined or `false`, the request will be added to the end of the first queue.

If your request depends on the result of another request, most likely you want to perform your request immediately after the previous one. Usually they are requests within the `firstComplete` or the `lastComplete` callback, or within a callback defined via the `subscribeToCartAjaxRequests` function. Set the `newQueue` to 'false' or omit it at all:

```javascript
subscribeToCartAjaxRequests(( requestState, subscribeToResult ) => {
	if ( requestState.requestType === 'add' ) {
		subscribeToResult( requestState => {

			// The cartRequestChange depends on any "add" request.
			// Omit the "newQueue" parameter or set it to false:
			cartRequestChange({…});
		})
	}
});

cartRequestAdd({…}, { newQueue: true, lastComplete: ( requestState ) => {
	
	// The cartRequestChange depends on the cartRequestAdd request.
	// Omit the "newQueue"  parameter or set it to false:
	cartRequestChange({…});
}});
```

If your request doesn't depend on any other requests, set the `newQueue` to `true`. Usually they are requests that get performed on user actions and you want the requests to be happen after all the previous request chains are finished:
```javascript
const button = document.querySelector('[data-my-button]');
if (button) {
	button.addEventListener('click', () => {
		cartRequestAdd({…}, { newQueue: true });
	})
}
```
