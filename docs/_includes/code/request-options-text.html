## Options

The `options` parameter is an object and it might have the following properties:

#### firstComplete

The `firstComplete` parameter is a function that will be called right after the request is finished and before any other callbacks that are subscribed to the request. 

This function is called before updating of the [State](/v1/reference/state/) object, the `data-ajax-cart-section` sections, the `body` CSS classes, the `data-ajax-cart-bind-state` elements.

The `firstComplete` function will be called with the only parameter — the [Request state](/v1/reference/requestState) object.

#### lastComplete

The `lastComplete` parameter is a function that will be called after the request is finished and after any other callbacks that are subscribed to the request. 

You can use the [`getCartState`](/v1/reference/getCartState/) function to read the [`State`](/v1/reference/state/) object because it is already updated.

Also the `data-ajax-cart-section` sections, the `body` CSS classes, the `data-ajax-cart-bind-state` are updated when the function is called.

The `lastComplete` function will be called with the only parameter — the [Request state](/v1/reference/requestState) object.

#### info

The `info` parameter is a simple Javascript object that will be attached to the [Request state](/v1/reference/requestState) object. You can add your own data to the request state using the `info` parameter.

Don't use the `initiator` and the `cancel` keys:
* [Product forms](/v1/reference/product-forms/) and [Controls](/v1/reference/controls/) that send Cart Ajax API requests attach their HTMLElement objects to the `initiator` property of the `info` parameter.
* If the `info` parameter has the `cancel` property and it is `true`, the request will not be performed. It might be useful when you intercept a Shopify Cart API request using the [subscribeToCartAjaxRequests](/v1/reference/subscribeToCartAjaxRequests/) function and decide to cancel the request.

#### newQueue

If the `newQueue` property is `true` then a new queue will be created and the request will be added to the new queue. Use it for requests that get performed on user actions:
```javascript
const button = document.querySelector('[data-my-button]');
if (button) {
  button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    cartRequestAdd({…}, { newQueue: true });
  })
}
```

If the `newQueue` is not defined or `false`, the request will be added to the end of the current queue. Use it for requests within `firstComplete`, `lastComplete` or `subscribeToCartAjaxRequests` callback functions when you want to have a request chain:

```javascript
subscribeToCartAjaxRequests(( requestState, subscribeToResult ) => {
  if ( requestState.requestType === 'add' ) {
    subscribeToResult( requestState => {

      // The cartRequestChange depends on any "add" request —
      // the cartRequestChange should be performed right after any "add" request is finished,
      // but before any other request from a next queue is started.
      // Omit the "newQueue" parameter or set it to false:
      cartRequestChange({…});
    })
  }
});
```
