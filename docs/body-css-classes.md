# Body CSS classes

Liquid Ajax Cart adds CSS classes to the `body` tag depending on a current state of a user's cart.

- `.js-ajax-cart-set` — if Liquid Ajax Cart has been loaded and got information about a user's cart state;
- `.js-ajax-cart-empty` — if a user's cart is empty;
- `.js-ajax-cart-request-in-progress` — if Liquid Ajax Cart has an AJAX request in progress.
